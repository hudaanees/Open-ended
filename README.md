#Integrated Weather Monitoring System in C:
this application retreive weather data from https://openweathermap.org/ public API.
this program contains:

--Data Retrieval:

**Interact with a free API to retrieve real-time environmental data (e.g., temperature, humidity).

--Data Processing and Analysis:

**Process the retrieved data using C programming concepts. Implement algorithms to analyze environmental data for anomalies or trends.

--Data Storage:

**Store both raw and processed environmental data in files.

--Reporting System:

**Develop a reporting system that generates reports based on the analyzed environmental data.

--Automation and Integration:

**Create shell scripts to automate tasks such as data retrieval, processing, and report generation. Integrate shell scripts with the C program to enhance automation.

--Optimization and Efficiency:

**Utilize pointers and dynamic memory allocation in the C program to optimize data manipulation and enhance 
efficiency.

--Real-time Alerts:

**Implement real-time alerts using Linux system calls to notify relevant personnel of critical environmental 
readings.

--Documentation and Code Organization:

**Develop comprehensive documentation for the monitoring system. Use header files to modularize the C code and enhance code readability.
